Overview
--------
Terrace is a system for streaming graphs that uses
a hierarchical data structure design to store a vertexâ€™s neighbors
in different data structures depending on the degree of the vertex.
This multi-level structure enables Terrace to dynamically partition
vertices based on their degrees and adapt to skewness in the
underlying graph. 

Build
-------
We implemented Terrace as a C++ library parallelized using Cilk Plus and the
Tapir branch of the LLVM compiler.

We recommend compiling Terrace with Clang++. We downloaded OpenCilk from
[here](https://github.com/OpenCilk/opencilk-project/releases). For recent
updates regarding OpenCilk please check [here](https://cilk.mit.edu/).

```bash
make graph_bm_no_update
./graph_bm_no_update -src 9 -maxiters 5 -f data/slashdot.adj
